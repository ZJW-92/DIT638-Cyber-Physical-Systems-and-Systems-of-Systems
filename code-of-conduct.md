# Group 16: Code of Conduct

## How do we plan to collaborate?
* We will work together on group assignments using Zoom and screen sharing when appropriate (i.e. pair programming).
* For individual assignments, we will help each other if a group member is having issues.
* If we choose to divide work up, all members will be available to help others during agreed working hours.
 
## How do we ensure that everyone in our group stays informed about the individual contributions?
* As we will be working together live for most, if not all of the assignments, we will ensure that all members get an equal amount of contribution by dividing up the commits appropriately.
* If work is divided up, we will have a stand up at the start of the working day to inform members of task progress.
* We will have check-in meetings regarding individual assignments to make sure that all team members are on track. 


## How do we ensure knowledge transfer among our team members?
* We will use the Discord text channel to post helpful links.
* If a team member doesn't understand something but another member does, the other member will do their best to explain it.
* If one team member writes code on their own, they must explain it fully to the other team members.
* Code will be commented to give full explanations.
 
## What is our usual communication plan?
* Meetings will take place on Zoom.
* Text communication through Whatsapp and Discord.
* Miscellaneous documents will be created and kept in a shared Google Drive folder.
* Members will notify the rest of the group if they are not able to meet the goals, deadlines or meetings (via any of our communication channels).
* Members are expected to be on time for meetings and other planned activities.
 
 
## How will we solve conflicts?   
* We plan to have open communication and transparency in the team. 
* If there are any issues within the team we will bring it up to the other members and do our best to resolve the conflict through discussion.
* If there are conflicts relating to working processes or how to approach something, we will vote as a team and go with the majority.
* To prevent potential conflicts due to the distance working environment, the team will take regular breaks. 
* If a team member feels that they need a moment away from the project, they can just inform the rest of the team and take a break.
